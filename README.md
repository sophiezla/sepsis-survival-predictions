# sepsis-survival-project

This project uses models to predict survival probabilities for people with Sepsis base upon several variables including episode number, sex and age. This project consists of 4 models, 1 main model using all covariates to the outcome of survival, and the additional 3 looking into the individual relationships. The results were graphed and put into tables. The data used in this project was sourced from Kaggle.
