# Sepsis Survival Project

This project aims to use logistic regression models to predict survival probabilities for people diagnosed with Sepsis by using the variables of episode number, sex and age. This project features four models: one comprehensive model using all covariates to predict the outcome of survival, and three additional models that delve into the individual relationships between specific variables and survival. By presenting the findings in the form of tables and graphs, they provide insight into predicting the probability of survival and the different variables that influence this probability.

The data set used was sourced from Kaggle.
